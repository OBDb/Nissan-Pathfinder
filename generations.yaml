    description: "The original Nissan Pathfinder was unveiled in May 1985 and introduced for the 1987 model year as a two-door body-on-frame SUV, sharing styling and components with the Nissan Hardbody Truck. A four-door version was introduced in October 1989 for the 1990 model year, though the wheelbase was not extended to accommodate rear doors. The first generation featured rugged, boxy styling with hidden rear door handles integrated into the C-pillar. Engine options included a 2.4L four-cylinder (KA24E) and a 3.0L V6 (VG30E), with part-time four-wheel drive featuring a two-speed transfer case. In Japan, it was sold as the Nissan Terrano with luxury appointments including climate-controlled air conditioning and Recaro seats. The generation ended in 1995, establishing the Pathfinder as a competitor to the Jeep Cherokee, Toyota 4Runner, and Ford Explorer in the growing SUV market."
