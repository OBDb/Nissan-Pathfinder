generations:
  - name: "First Generation (WD21)"
    start_year: 1987
    end_year: 1995
    description: "The original Nissan Pathfinder was introduced as a two-door SUV based on Nissan's compact pickup truck platform, later adding a four-door variant in 1990. Featuring boxy, utilitarian styling with a prominent front grille and angular wheel arches, it emphasized rugged capability over comfort. Initially powered by a 2.4L four-cylinder or 3.0L V6 engine, with a 3.3L V6 replacing both in later years. Transmission options included a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic, with part-time four-wheel drive featuring a two-speed transfer case for genuine off-road capability. The interior was basic but functional, focusing on durability rather than luxury, though later model years added more comfort features. This generation established the Pathfinder as a competitor to the Jeep Cherokee, Toyota 4Runner, and Ford Explorer in the growing SUV market, combining truck-based durability with increasing refinements to appeal to family buyers."

  - name: "Second Generation (R50)"
    start_year: 1996
    end_year: 2004
    description: "The second-generation Pathfinder made a significant transition to a unibody construction while maintaining body-on-frame ruggedness with its MonoFrame design. Available exclusively as a four-door, it featured more rounded styling, improved aerodynamics, and expanded interior space. Initially powered by a 3.3L V6 producing 168 horsepower, later upgraded to a more powerful 3.5L V6 generating 240 horsepower. Transmission options included a four-speed automatic or five-speed manual, with available part-time or all-time four-wheel drive systems. The interior saw substantial improvements in material quality, design, and features, with available amenities including leather seating, premium audio, and a sunroof. This generation balanced off-road capability with improved on-road comfort, offering a more sophisticated driving experience while maintaining adequate trail capability. Unique variants included the rugged-looking Pathfinder LE with body-colored fender flares and special interior appointments."

  - name: "Third Generation (R51)"
    start_year: 2005
    end_year: 2012
    description: "The third-generation Pathfinder returned to a traditional body-on-frame construction based on the Nissan F-Alpha platform shared with the Frontier and Titan, signaling a shift back toward ruggedness and towing capability. The exterior featured more angular styling with pronounced fender flares and an upright stance. Initially powered by a 4.0L V6 producing 270 horsepower, with a 5.6L V8 generating 310 horsepower added as an option in 2008. Both engines paired with a five-speed automatic transmission, with available part-time four-wheel drive featuring a two-speed transfer case and electronic locking rear differential in some configurations. The interior offered three rows of seating for up to seven passengers, with improved materials and technology including an available navigation system, Bluetooth connectivity, and rear-seat entertainment. This generation emphasized utility with up to 7,000 pounds of towing capacity, adjustable cargo organization systems, and substantial ground clearance, positioning it as a more capable alternative to increasingly car-based crossover competitors."

  - name: "Fourth Generation (R52)"
    start_year: 2013
    end_year: 2020
    description: "The fourth-generation Pathfinder represented a dramatic shift in philosophy, transitioning to a unibody crossover platform shared with the Nissan Murano and emphasizing on-road comfort and efficiency over off-road capability. The exterior featured more aerodynamic styling with flowing lines and a less aggressive stance. Powered exclusively by a 3.5L V6 engine initially producing 260 horsepower (later increased to 284 hp), paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT) and available with front-wheel or all-wheel drive lacking the low-range transfer case of previous generations. The interior prioritized family-friendly features with easy access to the third row via innovative sliding and tilting second-row seats, expanded cargo flexibility, and available premium features including a panoramic sunroof, Around View Monitor camera system, and Bose premium audio. A refresh in 2017 brought updated styling, enhanced technology including Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, and additional active safety features. This generation repositioned the Pathfinder as a mainstream three-row crossover competing with vehicles like the Toyota Highlander and Honda Pilot rather than traditional body-on-frame SUVs."

  - name: "Fifth Generation (R53)"
    start_year: 2021
    end_year: null
    description: "The current Pathfinder returns to a more rugged aesthetic while maintaining unibody construction, featuring bold, squared-off styling with a prominent V-motion grille, bluff front end, and muscular proportions that reference the original model's design ethos. Built on an updated version of Nissan's D platform, it prioritizes improved driving dynamics and capability without reverting to body-on-frame construction. Powered by a carried-over 3.5L V6 producing 284 horsepower but now paired with a conventional nine-speed automatic transmission replacing the previous CVT, available with front-wheel drive or an enhanced Intelligent 4WD system with seven drive and terrain modes. The interior features a completely redesigned dashboard with available 9-inch touchscreen, 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, and head-up display, alongside thoughtful family features like captain's chairs with a removable center console and one-touch folding seats providing easy third-row access. Seating capacity increases to eight passengers with the standard second-row bench. Technology advances significantly with standard Nissan Safety Shield 360, available ProPILOT Assist with Navi-link semi-autonomous driving capability, wireless Apple CarPlay, and enhanced connectivity features. Towing capacity increases to 6,000 pounds, and the more sophisticated all-wheel drive system provides improved all-weather performance. The fifth-generation Pathfinder balances a return to rugged styling and improved capability with modern technology and refinement, repositioning the model as a more adventurous option in the three-row crossover segment."
